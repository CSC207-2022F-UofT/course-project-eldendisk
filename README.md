# ELDEN DISK

Elden Disk is a text based single player game where the player has to beat a series of ten bosses to win. The player will be able to chose three classes, all of which have their individual pros and cons based on what type of enemy they are facing. On the characters turn, they will be able to either attack the enemy, use an item that will be purchasable through an in game trader, or purchase an item itself. Once the characters both use their moves the enemy will attack. After the battle players will receive experience and currency to be able to purchase items and level up. When the character beats all the bosses, are they declared the Elden Prince.
